# Data Pipeline Performance Evaluation Project - Milestone 1

## Overview

This project aims to evaluate the performance of a data pipeline using key parameters, including reliability, latency, I/O operations, and throughput, with a focus on processing a Wikipedia dataset. This document covers the first milestone of the project, which involves testing these parameters. The second milestone will focus on testing scalability and providing a final performance evaluation.

## Milestone 1: Testing Performance Parameters

### Reliability

To assess the reliability of the data pipeline, we've designed and implemented a robust data pipeline that reads data from a Wikipedia dataset, processes it, and writes the results. Reliability is crucial to ensure the pipeline handles data consistently and does not introduce errors during processing.

### Latency

We measure the latency of the data pipeline, recording timestamps at various stages to calculate the time taken for data to traverse each stage. Low latency is essential for real-time or near-real-time data processing scenarios.

### I/O Operations

We count the number of I/O operations, such as reading data from external sources and writing data to storage. Reducing I/O operations can lead to improved pipeline efficiency.

### Throughput

Throughput is measured by calculating the rate at which data is processed. It's essential to ensure that the pipeline can handle a high volume of data efficiently.

## Getting Started

To evaluate the performance parameters, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Run the provided code to assess reliability, latency, I/O operations, and throughput using a Wikipedia dataset.

```bash
python data_pipeline_performance.py
```

3. Analyze the output to review the reliability, latency, I/O operations, and throughput measurements.

## Milestone 2: Testing Scalability

The second milestone of this project will focus on scalability testing. We will simulate increased load by increasing data volume and frequency, as well as add more processing nodes or threads to the pipeline. This will help us understand how the data pipeline performs under varying workloads and resource configurations.

## Conclusion

This first milestone provides a foundation for evaluating the performance parameters of the data pipeline. By understanding reliability, latency, I/O operations, and throughput, we can make informed decisions to optimize our data processing workflows. In the next milestone, we will further test scalability and provide a final performance evaluation in the form of a text file.
